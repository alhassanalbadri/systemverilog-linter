# SystemVerilog Code Linting and Formatting Tool

This repository contains a code linting and formatting tool for SystemVerilog, designed to optimize your development workflow by ensuring code consistency and cleanliness. The tool includes a simple HTML interface for easy usage.

## Usage

This software is hosted on Github Pages, giving you access to the software without any setup overhead. Click here to visit the hosted website.


To utilize the code linting and formatting tool on a development environment:

1. Open the provided HTML interface (`index.html`) in your web browser.
2. Enter or paste your SystemVerilog code into the input area.
3. The formatted code will be automatically displayed in the output area, ready for use.


## Functionality

The tool operates by applying indentation rules and formatting guidelines to your SystemVerilog code. Key features currently include:

- **Indentation**: Proper indentation is applied to improve code readability and structure.
- **Comment Handling**: Comments and multi-line comments are preserved during the formatting process.
- **Module Definition**: Module parameters and declarations are indented appropriately.
- **Block Handling**: Begin-end blocks and logical blocks (if, else if, case, function, task) are formatted to enhance code organization.

## How It Works

The tool processes the SystemVerilog code by applying indentation rules and formatting guidelines. It preserves comments and multi-line comments during the formatting process. Module parameters and declarations are indented appropriately, and begin-end blocks and logical blocks (if, else if, case, function, task) are formatted to enhance code organization.

The formatted code is then displayed in the output area of the HTML interface, ready for use.
The tool is compatible with modern web browsers and can be easily integrated into your development environment.

## Roadmap

Here's a roadmap outlining possible enhancements and features:

- [ ] **Error Detection**: Implement checks to detect common errors and potential bugs in SystemVerilog code.
- [ ] **Improved HTML Interface**: Enhance the user interface for better usability and accessibility.
- [ ] **Customization Options**: Introduce user-configurable options to customize linting and formatting rules according to project requirements.
- [ ] **Documentation Update**: Expand and refine the documentation to provide comprehensive usage guidelines and examples.
- [ ] **Integration with IDEs**: Explore options for integrating the linting and formatting tool with popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for seamless usage.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the code processing algorithms to improve tool performance, particularly for larger codebases. Possibly adding support for multiple files system, acting as a basic IDE.
